## Development

To work on the color schemes, first [fork this repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) to your account. Clone it into your plugins directory, and install the dependencies. You will need [node & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:[YOUR_USERNAME]/admin-color-schemes.git
$ cd admin-color-schemes
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

You can also run `npm start` to watch the scss files as you work.

### Color Scheme Structure

Each color scheme has a folder, and in each folder is a `colors.scss` file, and 2 `.css` files. The CSS files are generated by the steps above, you should not need to edit these. A basic color scheme defines 3 variables, but you can add more. The list of variables you can define are in `_variables.scss`.

```scss
$base-color: #36395c;
$highlight-color: #8bbc9f;
$notification-color: #d2ac1f;
```

The last part of the `colors.scss` file is an import, which is how the scheme is generated. This is required, otherwise your color scheme won't work.

```scss
@import "../admin";
```

Now your scheme can be added to `admin-color-schemes.php` ðŸŽ¨

**Note:** `_admin.scss`, `_mixins.scss`, and `_variables.scss` are synced with WordPress core files, and shouldn't be edited.
